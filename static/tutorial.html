			<h1>Music Tier List Maker: Tutorial</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the Music Tier List Maker tutorial. This tutorial will cover all the basics of the MTLM editor. You can access the editor by going to the homepage and clicking the "Create" button.</p>
			
			<h1>Basic info</h1>
			
			<p>At the top of your tier list, you will have some basic info. The title of your tier list, your name, and a description of your tier list. You can edit these values simply by clicking on them and typing away.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/xRmMBai.png">
			<p>As a matter of fact, any text that is underlined with pink dots can be changed.</p>
			
			<h1>The Tier List</h1>
			
			<p>Your main tier list will start with a sample item in S-tier. You can move it around by clicking and dragging it between tiers.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHTHt9u.png">
			
			<h1>The Bin</h1>
			
			<p>Below your tier list is the bin. The bin is simply a place where you can work with items without putting them on your tier list. Note: Items in the bin will be removed once the tier list is published.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/AEbdDFc.png">
			<p>Above the bin are three buttons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first button, "Create New Item," will add a new blank item to the bin.</li>
				<li>The second button, "refresh," will reload the tier list by saving the current data and redrawing the tier list. If that sounds confusing, it doesn't matter too much anyways. It's just there in case you need it.</li>
				<li>The final button, "Remove Items From Bin," will delete all items in the bin. This is useful if you want to mass-delete items.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1>Editing Items</h1>
			
			<p>To edit an item, simply click on it once.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/WbfekRk.png">
			<p>You will see the following context menu. There are 4 fields you can edit:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The top line, in bold, is the item's title.</li>
				<li>The second line is the items description. You can use this field to explain your placement for that item.</li>
				<li>The third line, labeled "link URL," is the link the viewer will be sent to if the item is clicked. For example, an item for a song leading to it's music video on YouTube. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to include a link.</li>
				<li>The final line, labeled "image URL," is the image URL that will be shown on the tier list. For example: "https://example.com/image.png"</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you finish editing all the item's fields, you MUST click Apply to save the changes. If you want to deselect the item, click the Cancel button, click on any tier name/title, or pretend to drag an item.</p>
			
			<h1>Editing Tiers</h1>
			
			<p>Below The Bin is the Tier Manager.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/XmvAXNx.png">
			<p>The Tier Manager has two panels:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first panel allows you to click and drag to move tiers around. Clicking on a tier will select it for editing.</li>
				<li>The second panel allows you to edit a selected tier. You can edit its name and color. When you're finished editing a tier, you MUST click "apply changes" to save. You can also delete a tier. When deleting a tier, it WILL delete all the items that were inside it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Settings</h1>
			<p>Currently there are only two toggleable settings:</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/MeQY5dl.png">
			<p>Enable rankings will display a ranked number for each item. Counting up from #1 from left to right, top to bottom. Note: You cannot view rankings in the editor.</p>
			<p>Invert Text Colors will invert the colors of the tier names from white to black. This is useful if you used brighter colors for your tiers.</p>
			<h1>Saving</h1>
			<p>Finally we have the saving features.</p>
			<img class="tutorial_img" src="https://i.imgur.com/MGHzcXO.png">
			<p>Saving to LocalStorage / Loading from LocalStorage essentially allows you to save your tier list's progress. So you can close your window and come back later. Basically, it saves your tier list data on your computer through LocalStorage (kinda like cookies). Two notes: deleting website data/cookies from your browser will delete your LocalStorage data too. Also, you can only save one tier list at a time, so saving will overwrite your previous file.</p>
			<p>And at long last, publishing. When your tier list is finally 100% complete, click the publish button to publish the tier list to the website. When you do this, it will automatically redirect you to your tier list's page.</p>
			<p>Also that box that is below the publish button is your tier list's data. It might be hidden in a future update as the user doesn't really need to see it.</p>
